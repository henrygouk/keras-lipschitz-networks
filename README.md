Lipschitz Regularisation
========================

Keras implementation of a neural network regularisation technique based on a Lipschitz Constant Constraint (LCC) [1]. Currently only the L1 variant of the LCC method is implemented.

The hyperparameters have not yet been optimisation---they are currently is rough guess based on similar previous models I have trained using the same technique.
