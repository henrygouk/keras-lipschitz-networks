Lipschitz Regularisation
========================

Keras implementation of a neural network regularisation technique based on a Lipschitz Constant Constraint (LCC) [1].

This is quite a bare-bones demo of the technique, and the hyperparameters have not yet been optimised---they are currently a rough guess based on similar models I have trained using the same technique.
